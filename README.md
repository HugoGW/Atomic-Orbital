# Atomic-Orbital of an hydrogen atom
In this code, we plot the atomic structure of a hydrogen atom which is given by the wave function $\psi$.

I resolved analyticaly the Schr√∂dinger equation with the central potential : $V \equiv V(r)$ which is :

$ \displaystyle i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \Delta \psi - \frac{q^2}{4\pi^2\varepsilon_0 r}$
